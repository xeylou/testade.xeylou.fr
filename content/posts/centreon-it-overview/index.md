## introduction

The last article in this series will be devoted to discover & use Centreon IT.

Feel free to correct me by email if i've said something wrong.

### presentation

[Centreon IT](https://www.centreon.com) is french an open-source based monitoring solution.

It is highly [inspired by Nagios](https://www.centreon.com/centreon-and-nagios-3-milestones-to-understand-their-distinctiveness/), since it was a Nagios frontend at its beginning. 

Centreon's solutions has the same Nagios' plugins & hosts systems but can keep their hands on the plugins with their repository - where [the community can freely publish them for Nagios](https://www.xeylou.fr/posts/nagios-introduction/#fundamentals).

Centreon is a profit-oriented company who has a business model based on licensing the number of hosts monitored.

<!-- 

Quotation is based on the number of equipment devices being monitored. Prices start at 250 monitored devices, then 500, 1000, 2000â€¦ sky is the limit. Subscriptions include software licenses, access to our Support team by phone or by mail and unlimited software updates. And Managed Service Providers can benefit from a Pay-per-Use pricing model specifically designed to help them grow their business.

-->

The free solution called Centreon IT-100 is licensed for 100 monitored hosts only - called [Free Trial](https://www.centreon.com/free-trial/). Other differences with the commercial editions are listed in [their comparison table](https://www.centreon.com/centreon-editions/).

Informations on how Centreon IT works & its specific features.

### organisation

The solutions can be hosted on site, called `OnPrem` by Centreon, or cloud-based, called `Cloud`.

Centreon instances always works with a Central Server, called `centreon-central` used to configure monitoring, display & operate the collected data.

To monitor multiple sites, instances can be deployed & attached to a Central Server, the `Remote Servers`.

Monitored data is gathered using `Pollers`, attached to the Central or a Remote Server.

Here is what a `Centreon OnPrem` distributed architecture should looks like according to Centreon.

The `Centreon Cloud` architecture does away with Remote Servers, as Pollers are connected to the Central Server via the cloud - using a vpn.

### hosting 

[Centreon documentation](https://docs.centreon.com/) guides to host onprem & cloud solutions on different supports.

For an overview, they give `*.ovf` & `*.ova` images for virtual box & vmware respectively.

<!-- https://download.centreon.com/#Appliances/ -->
Installations alongside gnu/linux distros is preferable for production use.

<!-- https://docs.centreon.com/docs/installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-packages/ -->
The documentation guides it for RHEL, Alma/Oracle/Rocky Linux since they are rhel based distros - *(or "were" since [rhel closed their source](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/furthering-evolution-centos-stream))*.

Less attention is putted on Debian, the documentation is deprecated for it.

<!-- https://docs.centreon.com/docs/21.10/installation/installation-of-a-central-server/using-centreon-iso/ -->
<!-- https://download.centreon.com/#version-21-10/ -->
In the past - until ver. 21.10, they used to create `*.iso` images to install their solutions alongside centos.

### connectors & plugins

<!-- https://docs.centreon.com/cloud/monitoring/pluginpacks/ -->
Data collections can be made by templates called `Monitoring Connectors` who have assets of `Plugins`.

Plugins have the same function as Nagios ones.

Installed & used by pollers, they are sets of commands to monitor various kinds of metrics, on differents type of hosts regarding many protocols.

Plugins & connectors are maintained in their [centreon-plugins](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-plugins) & [centreon-connectors](https://github.com/centreon/centreon-connectors) repositories, where it seems community can contribute.

<!-- https://docs.centreon.com/docs/21.10/monitoring/pluginpacks/ -->
<!-- https://docs.centreon.com/docs/administration/licenses/ -->
Although it's opensource, a license is required to access the full Plugin Pack on their solutions.

## deploying

Installing Centreon IT-100, doing a simple windows & linux hosts monitoring.

### requirements

The infrastructure size depends on the number of hosts to monitor.

Centreon recommends using lvm to manage their file systems - working fine without, but should be planned for production use.

A stand-alone central server is used under 500 hosts. Pollers every 500 hosts are expected with a database server if more than 2'500 hosts.

For production use, it would be a good idea to think about scalability.

Since there would be to many informations to display (partitionning, specs, infrastructure), i let you refer to their [infrastructure sizes charts](https://docs.centreon.com/docs/installation/prerequisites/#characteristics-of-the-servers).

### infrastructure

The same [infrastructure use in the nagios article](https://www.xeylou.fr/posts/nagios-introduction/#infrastructure).

Here is what the used infrastructure looks.

### installation

Centreon IT will be installed without license on Debian 11.

I made an installation script available on [Github](https://github.com/xeylou/centreon-it-overview/deb11-centreon-install.sh).

To run it, run the following commands.

```bash
mkdir testing && cd testing
wget https://github.com/xeylou/centreon-it-overview/deb11-centreon-install.sh
chmod +x debian-centreon-install.sh
./debian-centreon-install.sh
```

This script installs Centreon IT from Centreon's apt repositories & instll a mysql server through mariadb.

Installation can be resume by going on the server web interface.
