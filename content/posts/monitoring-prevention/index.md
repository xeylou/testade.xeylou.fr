# introduction

i already talked about nagios & centreon before

as far as my understanding goes, i was confident talking about them

but then, someone asked me helping providing a monitoring solution from his needs

& i wasn't able to do so

because in my understanding, i put aside monitoring aspects to consider before deploying a monitoring solution

i couldn't come up with a decent plan, because of the such closed view i had on choosing a suitable solution

i wanted to came back to him, fully understanding its needs, restrictions & wants, to provide an appropriate solution

this article aims to help chosing an appropriate monitoring solution, based on studying needs, wants & infrastructures

# why need monitoring?

## monitoring != statistics

<!--

service discovery
taille de l'infra à monitorer
quelles actions on peut faire dessus (chez des clients pas pareil que chez nous)
criticité voulue (plus vers solution de homelab sympa ou propriétaire fermé)
