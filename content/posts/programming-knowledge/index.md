## introduction

i've been actively coding & programming for over 4 years now & i think i am safe to say i know a thing or two

here i merge knowledge to expose some coding & programming languages concepts

i won't be talking about programming, just coding & languages related stuff

coding is the way to implement things, learning how things works, e.g coding sorting algorithm - *insertion, selection, merge sort, etc.*

programming is the creation of something new: to sort in python, it is common to use the `sort` method when creating a software or an app

## languages levels

programming languages can be seperated in various categories, one of which is their proxmity to the computer language

### low-level
<!-- https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-a-low-level-language -->

low-level languages aim to be near computer language to manipulate its hardware

their code give computer hardware instructions to perform manipulations on the components

learning a low-level programming language makes you learn a lot about how components & their communications works

<!-- dealing w/ the hardware, they work to control computer's operational semantics & provide little or no abstraction of programming ideas -->

they are use to directly control computer's operational semantics & provide little or no abstraction of programming ideas

since they are dealing w/ the hardware, the code can change from a computer to another depending of the cpu architecture for example

they are oftenly non human-readable & have a relatively slow learning curve

those languages also let the programmer a wide control on data storage, memory or cpu usage

the assembly language or the machine language/binary code are two types of low-level languages if you want to dive into - *e.g: assembler*

they are commonly use to write kernels & drivers    

### high-level
<!-- https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/high-level-language/ -->
closer to human language, high-level languages are a goal for developping software

they help the developer by avoiding the need to manually give each instruction to components

instead, they use pre-built `methods` & `variables` to make the coding experience faster & simpler

variables creation is straightforward & methods do manipulation on them w/out seeing the components

it is much simpler to use since the developper can focus on the algebra, arithmetic or the algorithms

when comparing the performance of low & high-level languages for the same task, low-level ones is much faster: it require little interpretation by the computer

## paradigm
### imperatives
#### object-oriented
#### procedural
### declarative
#### functional
#### logic


programming model
parallel computing
execution model
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type -->
all high-level languages add-ons require the code to be understandable by the computer, in its computer language
### interpreted

donne des erreurs lors de l'exécution
### compiled
donne des erreurs lors du compil
### functional
### side note
<!-- python compile en bytecode puis interprete donc pas bon exemple -->

<!-- ## type of language
### machine language
### assembly language -->

<!-- ## simple objects
### intergers
### floats
### strings
### lists

### arrays -->

## structuring
<!-- bien préciser les différences, vitesse etc. -->
### object-oriented
### procedural

## typing
### dynamically typed
<!-- peut aller avec mutability/mutable objects -->
<!-- en python, un tableau peut devenir un entier, puis une chaine de charactère... -->
### statically typed
<!-- immutability objects? -->
<!-- typescript = js en statique -->

## concepts
### pointers
<!-- pour les deux en dessous prendre exemple de c & c++ -->
### heritage
### polymorphism
### paradigm    
### heuristic
### data structure
### libraries
