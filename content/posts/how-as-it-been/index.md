<!-- prologue -->

how as it been?

<!-- article -->

it's been a while since i posted or worked on something here

even though nobody waited for it, i will write something to remember me of what i've done until this date

## graduating

i graduated from my previous degree by my second year, it was a three year progam but i decided to leave by my second year

i still study academically, but for an engineering degree this time

i decided to leave because there is no need to wait for a third year to integrate the majority of engineering school in france. you can join after your second year of "but" or "licence" for most of them

i was also accepted in better schools than the one i am currently in, but i didn't think i was good enough to join them afterall

i had academic recommendations & teachers to encourage me doing it, but i still think i wasn't good enough; maybe i was wrong as they told me, maybe i would have had a better future; i will never have to know i guess

## moving

i had to move to get close to my new school

i struggled for months finding appartments and it was kind of stressful by the approaching back to school day

the reason for it was that i couldn't go there to visit, it was too far away and because don't have money nor a driving license to go anywhere for few days i was stuck with owners prefering getting people that could move to visit (undertandable)

now i am in, i have to live and rent for two appartments and that is not a choice

it sounds luxury but it's the opposite. i live in my school campus for my study periods and at people's house near my new job for my working ones

## getting a new job

i had the choice to keep my previous job when moving from my previous studies, still in a sandwich program alonside my new studies

i decided to move on to grow and have better opportunities in the future. i was working for a small it service delivery company and i wouldn't have applied what i would have learned more than my previous studies

although it was fine for my previous studies, we was 8 in the company and none of us was an engineer and the company didn't needed one for me

we were systems and network administrators, we didn't engineered anything at our scale. it's still fine to have and work for small companies and i loved working for them, but i had to move on for the best

i would also have to do hundred of miles every month between my school and my work places

finding a new job was also kind of stressful because people not responding or not quickly because of weird workflows or integration  processes... but i got the chance to get helped by my school and meet a good and comprehensive hr person

in fact, i applied for the job in the evening and she called me after my day's work (quite late) to tell me she would be active on the process and that she would organise a meeting with the teams by the very next day (which never happened in the companies i applied for)

i started working for a few weeks now, although i still need to get my bearings, i am happy to have joined this team

i am also happy to have parents that supported me on these episodes although they was scared after my graduation

i think my blog can also contain this kind of post, still related to work

i planned to get back on wheels with more cool stuff i found and i want to get my hands on

i will try to be more explanatory rather than jumping onto technical explainations like i did before - for you to also understand your potential needs too. and i will also try to have a wider view on what i am doing for you to also get better posts

thank you for reading, i hope you will find some posts interesting. if you want to chat you can always dm me on discord!

have a great day!
