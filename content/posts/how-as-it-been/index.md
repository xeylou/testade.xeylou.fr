<!-- prologue -->

how as it been?

<!-- article -->

it's been a while since i posted or worked on something here

even though nobody waited for it, i will write something to remember me of what i've done until this date

## graduating

i graduated from my previous degree by my second year, it was a three year progam but i decided to leave by my second year

i still study academically, but for an engineering degree

i decided to leave because there is no need to wait for a third year to integrate the majority of engineering school in france. you can join after your second year of "but" or "licence" for most of them

i was also accepted in better schools than the one i am currently in, but i didn't thought i was good enough to join them afterall

i had academic recommendations & teachers to encourage me doing it, but i still think i wasn't good enough; maybe i was wrong as they told me, maybe i would have had a better experience; i will never have to know

## moving

i had to move to get close to my new school

i struggled for months finding appartments and it was kind of stressful by the approaching back to school day

the reason was that i couldn't go there to visit, it was too far away and i didn't have the money nor a driving license to go there for few days and i was stuck with owners who preferred people to be able to move for visits (undertandable)

now i am in, i have to live and rent for two appartments and it's not by choice

it sounds luxury but it is the opposite. i live in my school campus for my study periods and at people's house near my new job for my working ones

## getting a new job

i had the choice to keep my previous job when moving from my previous studies, still in a sandwich program alonside my new studies

i decided to move on and grow to have better opportunities in the future. i was working for a small it service delivery company and i wouldn't have applied what i would have learned more than my previous studies if i was still there

although it was fine for my previous studies, we were 8 and none of us was an engineer and the company didn't need one

we were systems and network administrators. it's still fine to have and work for small companies and i loved working for them, but i had to move on for the best

i would also have had to do hundred of miles every month between my school and my work places

finding a new job was also kind of stressful because people was not responding or not quickly enough because of their integrations workflows... but i got the chance to get helped by my school and meet a nice and comprehensive hr person

in fact, i applied for the job in the evening and she called me after my day's work (quite late) to tell me she would be active on the process and that she would organize a meeting with the teams by the very next day (which never happened to me in the companies i applied for)

i started working for a few weeks now, although i still need to get my bearings, i am happy to have joined my team

i am confident that i'll succeed in my studies for now, i guess. i'll give it my true all

i am also happy to have parents that supported me on these episodes although they was scared for me since my graduation

i think my blog can also contain this kind of post, still related to work

i planned to get back on wheels with more cool stuff i found out and i want to get my hands on

i will try to be more explanatory rather than jumping onto technical explainations like i have done before - for you to understand your potential needs too. and i will also try to have a wider view on what i am doing for you to get better posts

thank you for reading this, i hope you will find some posts interesting. if you want to chat you can always dm me on discord!

have a great day,
